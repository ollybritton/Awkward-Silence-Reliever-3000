It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don\u2019t do, to find out the real story \u2013 and the real story is that there is no pay to play.\n\n\u201cIt was natural for people who\u2019ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn\u2019t do anything they shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN\n\nIn other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there\u2019s no evidence they got them.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the foundation the media doesn\u2019t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn\u2019t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump\u2019s charitable foundation over concerns that it \u201cengaged in some impropriety\u201d as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others\u2019 contributions \u201cto make them appear to have come from him\u201d although he \u201chasn\u2019t given to the foundation since 2008.\u201d Source: Media Matters\n\nMedia Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton\u2019s candidacy:\n\nJournalists have been criticized for the \u201cdouble standard\u201d in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton\u2019s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post\u2019s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump\u2019s Dr. Oz stunt.\n\nAll of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton \u201cscandal\u201d (if you call getting sick a \u201cscandal\u201d) while ignoring every scandal in Trump\u2019s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.\n\nFeatured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images.", "authors": ["Wendy Gittleson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "These headlines are really damning, unless you actually read beyond them.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Wendy Gittleson", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "These headlines are really damning, unless you actually read beyond them.", "title": "Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/proof-the-mainstream-media-is-manipulating-the-election-by-taking-bill-clinton-out-of-context/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-605695152.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "These headlines are really damning, unless you actually read beyond them.", "title": "Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/proof-the-mainstream-media-is-manipulating-the-election-by-taking-bill-clinton-out-of-context/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-605695152.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/"}, "keywords": "Bill Clinton, Clinton Foundation, clinton pay to play, Crooked Hillary, Hillary Clinton, political corruption, Trump foundation", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/proof-the-mainstream-media-is-manipulating-the-election-by-taking-bill-clinton-out-of-context/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-10.28.21-AM.jpg", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-605695152.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7967831c4b263398ad7227f53695cfda?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "http://addictinginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context", "url": "http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/19/proof-the-mainstream-media-is-manipulating-the-election-by-taking-bill-clinton-out-of-context/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474243200000}, "source": "http://www.addictinginfo.org"}

The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they\u2019re an organization for good.\n\nThe Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:\n\nJust 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization\u2019s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and \u201cother expenses.\u201d The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization\u2019s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as \u201cother expenses,\u201d while the remaining almost $851K was marked as \u201cprofessional fundraising expenses.\u201d Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more \u201cother expenses\u201d in 2014.\n\nSometimes, things are exactly as they appear.

The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative.

It also promotes Obama\u2019s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White\u2013which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.\n\nIf Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?\n\nIf his birth in America is valid \u2014 as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the \u2018foreigner\u2019 card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of \u2026 whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.\n\nBecause if That WASN\u2019T a lie\u2026 then something else MUST be.

Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.\n\nThe congressional report focused on Clinton\u2019s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.\n\nIt also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.\n\nRanbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.\n\nThe Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation\u2019s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,\u201d said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.\n\n\u201cWhen companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA\u2019s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,\u201d said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.\n\nThe Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, \u201calleged due to the company\u2019s diluted drugs, it \u2018subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,\u2019\u201d according to the report.\n\n\u201cThe question becomes, \u2018how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,\u2019\u201d asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.\n\nThe possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nBlackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term.\n\nThe congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation\u2019s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.\n\nIt is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the \u201cwatered-down\u201d drugs.\n\nProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered \u201cmore than $1.8 million packages.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubstandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,\u201d Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.\n\nThakur told TheDCNF that many of the company\u2019s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.\n\n\u201cThese drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,\u201d he said.\n\nRanbaxy\u2019s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.\n\nThe FDA sent a public \u201cwarning letter\u201d to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company\u2019s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, \u201cshow much lower potencies in these batches.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ranbaxy\u2019s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company\u2019s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.\n\nBill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.\n\nNeither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.\n\nThakur said he\u2019s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on \u201caccess\u201d to patients.\n\nThe whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. \u201cI have tried to reach out to them,\u201d he told TheDCNF. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.\u201d\n\nCHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.\n\nCharles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was \u201cdeeply suspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called \u2018CHAI\u2019 was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,\u201d Ortel told TheDCNF.\n\nThe congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.\n\nHe signed an executive order that, \u201crelaxed intellectual property policy standards,\u201d promising the U.S. government \u201cwould not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any \u2018Sub-Saharan country\u2019 relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,\u201d the report states.\n\nCHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nCHAI\u2019s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief \u2014 a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton\u2019s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become \u201cgood acquisition targets,\u201d according to the study.\n\nRanbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.\n\nThe companies enjoyed great financial profits and they \u201cexploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.\n\nOne relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.\n\nRajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.\n\nVinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.\n\nBlackburn says the worst part of the story were the \u201cfalse hopes\u201d offered by the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\u201cYou think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it\u2019s disturbing and very sad,\u201d she said.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by

{"top_img": "http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/administration.jpg", "text": "After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter\u2019s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton\u2019s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.\n\nThe different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.\n\nAside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary\u2019s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.\n\nSince the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.\n\nThe question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?\n\nWhat we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.\n\nIt is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.\n\nIf anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.\n\nThe American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com", "authors": ["View All Posts", "Tony Elliott"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.", "og": {"site_name": "Eagle Rising", "description": "Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.", "title": "A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/administration.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-09-21T00:50:37+00:00", "url": "http://eaglerising.com/36880/a-hillary-clinton-administration-may-be-entirely-run-by-a-figurehead/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noimageindex", "fb": {"app_id": 256195528075351, "pages": 135665053303678}, "article": {"section": "2016 Election", "published_time": "2016-09-21T00:10:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-09-21T00:50:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "noimageindex"}, "canonical_link": "http://eaglerising.com/36880/a-hillary-clinton-administration-may-be-entirely-run-by-a-figurehead/", "images": ["http://constitution.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/confederatemonument_poll_pop.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/crtv_300x600_2.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/eagle-rising-logo3-1.png", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bodyguards-375x195.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46729-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46764-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46731-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46745-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Tony-Elliott.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46654-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/administration.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46750-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46612-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46761-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46642-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46735-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46755-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46752-featured-300x130.png", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46748-featured-300x130.png", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46715-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46743-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46712-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/administration-800x300.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46757-featured-300x130.png", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/isis-1-375x195.jpg"], "title": "A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD \u2013 Eagle Rising", "url": "http://eaglerising.com/36880/a-hillary-clinton-administration-may-be-entirely-run-by-a-figurehead/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474416638000}, "source": "http://eaglerising.com"}

He\u2019s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned \u201crapists\u201d and \u201cdrug dealers\u201d from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a \u201ctemporary measure.\u201d He\u2019s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:\n\n\u201cThe other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don\u2019t kid yourself. When they say they don\u2019t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.\u201d\n\nBut he\u2019s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald\u2019s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism \u2014 he\u2019s fighting the \u201cnarratives\u201d of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump\u2019s \u201cnarrative\u201d is \u201ckill them all\u201d:\n\nLast weekend\u2019s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama\u2019s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we\u2019re in more than a fight about \u2018narratives\u2019 \u2013 these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.\n\nPay attention to that last bit: \u201cThey must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.\u201d\n\nNow, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating \u201cterrorists?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re protecting each other, but they\u2019re really doing very bad damage \u2014 they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,\u201d Trump said in March. \u201cWhen they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that\u2019s a big problem.\u201d\n\nIf Muslims are \u201cprotecting\u201d terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump\u2019s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists\u2019 families. How would he define terrorism?\n\nThese are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself \u2014 but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents\u2019 security to \u201csee what happens\u201d to them (shortly after suggesting that \u201cSecond Amendment People\u201d could deal with them. We\u2019re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the \u2018little red button\u2019 that launches our nuclear arsenal.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen \u2014 one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.\n\nNormally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He\u2019s said it himself. Many times.\n\nIf we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation \u2014 to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it\u2019s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.\n\nFeatured image via Getty Images/Joe Raedle", "authors": ["John Prager"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "If Trump becomes President, this will not end well.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "John Prager", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "If Trump becomes President, this will not end well.", "title": "Trump\u2019s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/trumps-latest-campaign-promise-may-be-his-most-horrible-one-yet/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-4.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If Trump becomes President, this will not end well.", "creator": "@EvilLiberalPig", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/trumps-latest-campaign-promise-may-be-his-most-horrible-one-yet/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-4.jpg", "title": "Trump's Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/iamyourknight"}, "keywords": "Adolf Hitler, Barack Obama, concentration camps, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Trump, trump 2016", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/trumps-latest-campaign-promise-may-be-his-most-horrible-one-yet/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/896e3249030ff74276709a1914c25ea3?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-4.jpg", "http://addictinginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "Trump\u2019s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet", "url": "http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/19/trumps-latest-campaign-promise-may-be-his-most-horrible-one-yet/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474243200000}, "source": "http://www.addictinginfo.org"}

{"top_img": "http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/charity.jpg", "text": "Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation \u2013 where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners \u2013 the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed \u201cgood\u201d that the foundation has done over the years.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they\u2019re an organization for good.\n\nThe Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:\n\nJust 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization\u2019s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and \u201cother expenses.\u201d The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization\u2019s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as \u201cother expenses,\u201d while the remaining almost $851K was marked as \u201cprofessional fundraising expenses.\u201d Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more \u201cother expenses\u201d in 2014.\n\nSometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com", "authors": ["Philip Hodges", "View All Posts"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes.", "og": {"site_name": "Eagle Rising", "description": "The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes.", "title": "Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity;

{"top_img": "http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hillary-clinton-1.jpg", "text": "I can\u2019t wait for \u201cWeekend at Chelsea\u2019s\u201d to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton\u2019s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups \u2013 these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low \u2013 would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a \u201cminor setback\u201d to her \u201cinevitable\u201d victory.\n\nThe American people aren\u2019t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d dismissals. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cmild cold,\u201d er, \u201cseasonal allergies,\u201d I mean \u201cheat exhaustion,\u201d that is to say \u201cminor case of pneumonia\u201d is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a \u201cmystery man\u201d who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable \u201cepisodes\u201d (or otherwise freezes up with a brain \u201cshort-circuit\u201d during a speech).\n\nThis guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.\n\nBlue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013 a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has \u201cpneumonia\u201d required a neurological squeeze test?).\n\nThe Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won\u2019t, but they should. I wonder what official \u201cdiagnosis\u201d we\u2019ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they\u2019ve been there a hundred times before. \u201cNothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton\u2019s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she \u2018powered through\u2019 yesterday going door-to-door.\u201d\n\nThe point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She\u2019s proven, yet again, that she can\u2019t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She\u2019s a liar. That\u2019s her default mode. She\u2019s corrupt. And she\u2019s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else \u2013 including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.\n\nDo I take joy in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. \u201cDo not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice\u201d (Proverbs 24:17).\n\nIndeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters as a \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cirredeemable\u201d \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d has only served to accelerate the plunge.\n\nPerhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement \u2013 especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her \u201cfriend and mentor.\u201d Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags \u2013 the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.\n\nWho\u2019s the racist?\n\nI\u2019m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can\u2019t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.\n\nIt\u2019s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she\u2019s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she\u2019s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, \u201cMany are the plans in a person\u2019s heart, but it is the LORD\u2019s purpose that prevails.\u201d\n\nAm I saying there\u2019s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there\u2019s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.\n\nStill, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton\u2019s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector \u2013 a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.\n\nWhen they visit her in prison.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com", "authors": ["View All Posts", "Matt Barber"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Am I saying there\u2019s no chance Hillary Clinton will win?

He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his \"JV team.\"\n\nSeeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.\n\nThe Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.\n\n\"If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,\" said Obama.\n\nPresident Obama continued by saying that we must \"be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.\"\n\nHe mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as \"a place like Syria, where there\u2019s no ultimate military victory to be won.\"\n\nInstead Obama suggested that we \"pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.\"\n\nWhich may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.\n\nIt's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.\n\nIt's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.\n\nIt's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.\n\nMake sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.\n\nSource: Conservative Tribune", "authors": ["Crispin White"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "US Herald", "description": "Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N.

{"top_img": "http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/administration.jpg", "text": "After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter\u2019s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton\u2019s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.\n\nThe different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.\n\nAside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary\u2019s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.\n\nSince the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.\n\nThe question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?\n\nWhat we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.\n\nIt is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.\n\nIf anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.\n\nThe American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com", "authors": ["View All Posts", "Tony Elliott"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.", "og": {"site_name": "Eagle Rising", "description": "Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.", "title": "A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/administration.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-09-21T00:50:37+00:00", "url": "http://eaglerising.com/36880/a-hillary-clinton-administration-may-be-entirely-run-by-a-figurehead/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noimageindex", "fb": {"app_id": 256195528075351, "pages": 135665053303678}, "article": {"section": "2016 Election", "published_time": "2016-09-21T00:10:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-09-21T00:50:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "noimageindex"}, "canonical_link": "http://eaglerising.com/36880/a-hillary-clinton-administration-may-be-entirely-run-by-a-figurehead/", "images": ["http://constitution.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/confederatemonument_poll_pop.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/crtv_300x600_2.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/eagle-rising-logo3-1.png", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bodyguards-375x195.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46729-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46764-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46731-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46745-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Tony-Elliott.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46654-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/administration.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46750-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46612-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46761-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46642-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46735-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46755-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46752-featured-300x130.png", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46748-featured-300x130.png", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46715-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46743-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46712-featured-300x130.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/administration-800x300.jpg", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/46757-featured-300x130.png", "http://2lv0hm3wvpix464wwy2zh7d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/isis-1-375x195.jpg"], "title": "A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD \u2013 Eagle Rising", "url": "http://eaglerising.com/36880/a-hillary-clinton-administration-may-be-entirely-run-by-a-figurehead/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474416638000}, "source": "http://eaglerising.com"}

Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it\u2019s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton\u2019s schedule.\n\nInteresting fact\u2026.I just searched Hillary Clinton\u2019s rally events scheduled between September 20 \u2013 October 19 \u2013 She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn\u2019t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!\n\nThere are many questions about her health, and admittedly I\u2019m no expert. However I am a realist.\n\nI recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton\u2019s left hand.\n\nI further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.\n\nFurther rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn\u2019t appear to want to be president any longer.\n\nNo matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.\n\nAs for Hillary Clinton\u2019s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won\u2019t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the \u201cconspirators.\u201d\n\nWorse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.\n\nExpect lots more on this to surface over the next few days.", "authors": ["Kevin Jackson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

There\u2019s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.\n\nWhat that means is that under Trump\u2019s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I\u2019m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn\u2019t about the narrative. It isn\u2019t about prevention or education.\n\nIt\u2019s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.\n\nThe only solace we have is that what he\u2019s promising is nothing but another \u201cread my lips.\u201d Terrorism isn\u2019t something you can simply \u201cdestroy\u201d just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn\u2019t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.\n\nFeatured image from file", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "Democrats Winning the Hearts and Minds", "description": "Not only is it unrealistic, it's unconstitutional as hell.", "title": "Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes \u2018Read My Lips\u2019 Look Good", "url": "http://oppositionreport.com/trump-just-made-a-campaign-promise-so-ridiculous-it-makes-read-my-lips-look-good/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-599936028.jpg", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-599936028.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1555147758043521}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cropped-2015-12-18_18-30-53-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1; maximum-scale=1; user-scalable=0;"}, "canonical_link": "http://oppositionreport.com/trump-just-made-a-campaign-promise-so-ridiculous-it-makes-read-my-lips-look-good/", "images": ["http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-599936028.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Baio-Fox.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-5.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/themes/ares/data/1488260315_logo copy.jpg", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/01de25360ee280d1bd8f0b9a1f25034e?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/trump-1-6.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/trump-11.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/joe-raedle-houston-flood-getty-OR.jpg"], "title": "Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes \u2018Read My Lips\u2019 Look Good \u2039 Opposition Report", "url": "http://winningdemocrats.com/trump-just-made-a-campaign-promise-so-ridiculous-it-makes-read-my-lips-look-good/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://winningdemocrats.com"}

Ray Odierno believes we\u2019ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.\n\nSpeaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; \u201cThe Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.\"\n\nHowever the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president\u2019s astounding incompetence, there\u2019s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.\n\nThe General went on to explain; \"Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,\" Odierno said. \"Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.\"\n\nThe Army has cut 80,000 soldiers out of the active force, reorganized and cut 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades from the active component.

The National Democratic Party, a \u201cpowerful hate group,\u201d has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.\n\n[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America\u2019s Most Powerful HATE Group\n\nAs a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author\u2019s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get \u201cHillary the Horrible\u201d into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.\n\nA proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone \u2013 especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President \u2013 to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.\n\nThe proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters \u2013 but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens \u2013 to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.\n\nDue to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.\n\nDonald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America\u2019s most powerful \u201cHate Group,\u201d not only wants \u201cHillary the Horrible\u201d to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.\n\nLet us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either

{"top_img": "http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hillary-6.jpg", "text": "A Daisy of a Rerun\n\nI am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.\n\nThe year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson \u201capproved\u201d that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly \u201cwar mongering\u201d opponent, Barry Goldwater.\n\nToday, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson\u2019s deceitful war policies, Goldwater\u2019s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation\u2019s media.\n\nI mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.\n\nObviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a \u201cDaisy\u201d remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.\n\nSomehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater\u2019s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.\n\nInstead, today\u2019s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as \u201cnews and views.\u201d With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media\u2019s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.\n\nNow, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted\u2019s \u201cdramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.\u201d This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a \u201cpathological liar\u201d and \u201cutterly amoral.\u201d\n\nAs the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of \u201c\u2019Lyin Ted,\u2019 insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.\u201d These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.\n\nSchools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?\n\nAnother safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say \u201cderogatory\u201d when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the \u201cliberal press\u201d moniker has now everyday acceptance.\n\nIt is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public\u2019s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.\n\nAlso, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.\n\nThese quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.\n\nWith that, consider the President\u2019s past considerations of today\u2019s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, \u201cShe will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can\u2019t be trusted and isn\u2019t qualified to be President.\u201d\n\nObviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it\u2019s damning, given the time frame.\n\nAlso during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: \u201cIf you can\u2019t run your own house, you certainly can\u2019t run the White House.\u201d\n\nApparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.\n\nAgain, wouldn\u2019t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com", "authors": ["View All Posts", "Jim Bowman"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Obama stated of Hillary, \u201cShe will say anything and change nothing.

{"top_img": "http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/njbombing.jpg", "text": "196 SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nFor a little over a decade today\u2019s millennials have been described as being part of the \u201ceveryone gets a trophy generation.\u201d Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.\n\nWould you believe that the man behind Saturday\u2019s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of \u201cIslamophobia?\u201d This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.\n\nThe journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here\u2019s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):\n\nThe prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and \u2018selective enforcement\u2019 based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with \u2018baseless\u2019 tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: \u2018Muslims don\u2019t belong here\u2019. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.\n\nNo, you\u2019re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.\n\nMayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. \u201cIt was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,\u201d Bollwage said, adding, \u201cIt had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.\u201d\n\nRahami\u2019s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can\u2019t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.\n\nWelcome to Obama\u2019s America \u2013 where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!\n\nHow insane is this?

Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we\u2019ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was \u201cPapa\u201d John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees\u2019 hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn\u2019t.\n\nThis year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn\u2019t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s. Here\u2019s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:\n\nJudging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that\u2019s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn\u2019t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:\n\n\u201cI want to try it,\u201d CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. \u201cWe could have a restaurant that\u2019s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.\u201d \u201cWith government driving up the cost of labor, it\u2019s driving down the number of jobs,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.\u201d \u201cThis is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,\u201d says Puzder. \u201cDoes it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?\u201d Source: Yahoo Finance\n\nThis threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He\u2019s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.\n\nPuzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.\n\nPuzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don\u2019t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.\n\nYou can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That\u2019s just the way he is: profits over people.", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Groopspeak", "description": "This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.", "generator": "WordPress 4.6.1", "author": "admin", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href=", "title": "Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency", "url": "http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/", "image": "http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.", "creator": "@editor", "url": "http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/", "image": "http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg", "title": "Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency", "site": "@groopspeak", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 636595649691481}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/", "images": ["http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png", "http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg", "http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g"], "title": "Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency", "url": "http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/", "summary": "", "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0"], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://author.groopspeak.com"}

It sounds unreal, but that\u2019s the truth in Obama\u2019s America.\n\nWe\u2019re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran\u2019s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.\n\nTrump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today.

Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA.

In fact, it\u2019s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.\n\nThis is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises\u2026 because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton\u2026 EVER.\n\nFrom Bearing Arms:\n\nWe told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn\u2019t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.\n\nFalconer\u2019s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.\n\nThe 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer\u2019s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.\n\nClinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers \u201cimmunity.\u201d It\u2019s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.\n\nJason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more.

{"top_img": "http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hillary-look-old.jpg", "text": "978 SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nI don\u2019t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton\u2019s health constantly making headline, but it\u2019s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.\n\nHere are the top takeaways from the poll:\n\n\u2022More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either \u201cbelow average\u201d or \u201cvery poor\u201d health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That\u2019s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.\n\n\u2022The share of voters who think Clinton\u2019s health is \u201caverage\u201d remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either \u201cabove average\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).\n\n\u2022Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton\u2019s potential medical issues.\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she\u2019s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60\u2019s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually \u2018looking old\u2019 or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can\u2019t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary\u2019s health. The suspicion isn\u2019t from one particular thing, it\u2019s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.\n\nAt one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady\u2019s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting \u2018confused and needing naps\u2019, of which she was probably severely punished.\n\nAnd then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn\u2019t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.\n\n\n\nAnother of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.\n\n\n\nThen there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone\u2019s arm.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don\u2019t see her in person because she looks awful.\n\n\n\nAnd of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she\u2019s gasping for air. It\u2019s incredibly alarming to have such a sickly candidate because she could be the next *Cough Cough HmHmm Uck Khoff Khak Khak Gack \u2014 *GASP excuse me, President of the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Freedom Daily", "description": "It's incredibly alarming to have such a sickly candidate because she could be the next President of the United States.", "title": "UNFIT!

I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.\n\nI cannot say that I don\u2019t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It\u2019s just\u2026 is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.\n\nIt\u2019s going to blow up in his face.\n\nIn Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore\u2026 it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?\n\nYou be the judge of that.\n\nThe job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of \u201call things dangerous\u201d then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It\u2019s not possible.\n\nYou can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.\n\nAs if their job wasn\u2019t already hard enough in Obama\u2019s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being \u201cdisproportionately\u201d targeted, they can run.\n\nYes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.\n\nUp until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that\u2019s \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it\u2019s not important to get evidence when it\u2019s fresh, because it could hurt a thug\u2019s feelings.\n\nBasically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve\u2026if there\u2019s a runner.\n\nWhich\u2026let\u2019s be real, what thug doesn\u2019t run?\n\nPunchline: The law abiding ones!\n\nI\u2019m so funny.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Freedom Daily", "description": "You're not going to believe this...", "title": "No WAY!

Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.\n\nThe Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.\n\nThe Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.\n\nThe situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer\u2019s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.\n\nSpeaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him.

She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,\n\n\u201cIf I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.\u201d\n\nThese comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin\u2019s Sunday elections. She also said,\n\n\u201cIf I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.\u201d\n\nShe took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.\n\nThe results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.\n\nRegardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.\n\nHowever, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.\n\nMerkel stated,\n\n\u201cIf people don\u2019t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany\u2019s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.\u201d\n\nChristian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,\n\n\u201cIt is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.\u201d\n\nThe growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain\u2019t broke don\u2019t fix it.\n\nThis could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama\u2019s and Hillary Clinton\u2019s. She is no different which is why many Americans too cannot stand her.", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "German chancellor Angela Merkel's political party suffered a landslide defeat in their elections.

Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn\u2019t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.\n\nHe had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.\n\nThe story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren\u2019t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.\n\nThank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a \u2018disobedient\u2019 woman. Especially when pregnant.\n\nQuran 4:34 \u2014 So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband\u2019s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance \u2013 [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.\n\nJust in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of \u201cbeat them,\u201d the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.\n\nI wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims which he is following.", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Freedom Daily", "description": "He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard do of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money.", "title": "SICK!

If you do that, we\u2019re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion \u2013 I really mean this, Pennsylvania \u2013 is if cheating goes on.\u201d\n\nTrump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to \u201cStop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!\u201d\n\nIn response to Trump\u2019s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.\n\nWith the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump\u2019s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.\n\nFeatured Image: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images", "authors": ["Stephen D Foster Jr"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Stephen D Foster Jr", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.", "title": "Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/22/republicans-push-bill-to-legalize-voter-intimidation-to-help-trump-in-pennsylvania/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Trump-Bannon.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.", "title": "Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/22/republicans-push-bill-to-legalize-voter-intimidation-to-help-trump-in-pennsylvania/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Trump-Bannon.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/"}, "keywords": "Donald Trump, House Bill 29, Pennsylvania, Republicans, voter intimidation", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/22/republicans-push-bill-to-legalize-voter-intimidation-to-help-trump-in-pennsylvania/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://addictinginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/51f1e004223453ced550219e1431c60d?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Trump-Bannon.jpg"], "title": "Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania", "url": "http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/22/republicans-push-bill-to-legalize-voter-intimidation-to-help-trump-in-pennsylvania/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474502400000}, "source": "http://www.addictinginfo.org"}

Such wasn\u2019t the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab.\n\nAs it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she\u2019s representing.\n\nAccording to her, as quoted by The Federalist Papers:\n\n[I feel unsafe] all the time. I had someone follow me home from practice and try to report me to police. And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City\u2026 I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don\u2019t come even close to things we\u2019ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It\u2019s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.\u201d\n\nHow terrible \u2013 but let\u2019s not pretend that we live in an \u201cIslamophobic\u201d country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.\n\nIf she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn\u2019t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer \u2013 because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.\n\nShe\u2019s not going to be stoned to death in America. She\u2019s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She\u2019s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She\u2019s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.\n\nWhen that\u2019s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og":

The idiots there turned a \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.\n\nGo figure. They can\u2019t even play the race card on this one, but they\u2019ll still wreck a town for no reason.\n\nIt makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?\n\nNothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.\n\nDing ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn\u2019t listen to police.\n\nThat must mean it\u2019s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don\u2019t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.\n\nMadworld News \u2013 Rioters swarmed this man\u2019s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It\u2019s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don\u2019t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn\u2019t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.\n\nIf I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I\u2019d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they\u2019d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.\n\nBlack Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They\u2019re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.\n\nBlack Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.\n\nThey\u2019re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they\u2019re white. They attack people just because they\u2019re white.\n\nThey call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can\u2019t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.\n\nI judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.\n\nBased off what I\u2019ve seen so far, I can proudly say F*ck Black Lives Matter and the hoopty they drove in on.", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "generator": "Powered

Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.\n\nDuring his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.\n\nObama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he\u2019s enjoying that Gilligan\u2019s Island by himself.\n\nHow ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It\u2019s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.\n\nWatch President Obama\u2019s full speech here,", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "President Obama gave a speech at the United Nations general assembly where he called for THIS.

The other is an idiot.\n\nTim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick\u2019s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.\n\nTebow is known for his religious antics, \u201cTebowing\u201d celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.\n\nHis comments about Kaepernick were as follows\u2026\n\n\u201cWhen people have belief in something,\u201d said Tebow, \u201cor conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it\u2019s all about standing for it the right way.\u2019\n\nKeyword is \u201cSTANDING\u201d which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He\u2019s a high paid bench player and he\u2019s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.\n\nIf he wants to protest, that\u2019s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald\u2019s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.\n\nClaiming you\u2019re oppressed is really you admitting you\u2019re lazy and don\u2019t want to work for anything.\n\nHow did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn\u2019t oppressed.\n\nName one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.\n\nI can tell you what they can do to better themselves.\n\nI can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.\n\nIf anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.\n\nTim Tebow was short on words because he\u2019s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He\u2019s too busy working on his career path.\n\nGood for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!\n\nScrew Kaepernick.", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for

China didn\u2019t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.\n\nWe need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they\u2019ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious.

Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. \u201cBorder Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,\u201d he said. \u201cOur agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.\u201d\n\nIt would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.\n\nBorder Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that \u201cEight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,\u201d Garza explained. \u201cUnfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying

Islam isn\u2019t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they\u2019ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.\n\nThe insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.\n\nDemocrats think the world will agree with them, and they\u2019re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:\n\nA new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.\n\nSo Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says \u201cAmerica first\u201d it\u2019s suddenly racist.\n\nOk, yeah, that sounds logical.\n\nSixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. \u201cFloored\u201d by the results, the pollster laments that the \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d, who he previously thought were just a \u201cmarginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia\u201d, is too big to ignore. He writes: \u201cThis not a \u2018basket of deplorables\u2019 who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. \u201cYes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or \u2018other\u2019 but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.\u201d\n\nDo you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don\u2019t call them \u201cdeplorables,\u201d you recognize that half the country is against you.

In fact, it is one of his life\u2019s purposes to serve and help his \u2018brothers and sisters\u2019 in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.\n\nOn the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.\n\nFor this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith\u2026he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.\n\nHe has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.\n\n\u201cIn terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,\u201d Wilson concluded. \u201cI think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don\u2019t stress out about much.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to\u2026 themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.\n\nGood men\u2019s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.\n\nEspecially now in Obama\u2019s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there\u2026if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share\u2026 corruption can and will take root.\n\nSo the NFL told him not to talk about his faith\u2026\n\nInteresting how things seem so one sided right? Don\u2019t talk about God, it hurts people\u2019s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it\u2019s heroes.\n\nWith this kind of garbage happening\u2026the truth becomes that much more obvious.\n\nWords like \u2018tolerance\u2019 are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.\n\nAsk yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?\n\nThere is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.\n\n\u2026and Obama\u2019s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",

Spreading rumors is an example of \u201cterrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue\u201d, he said. \u201cThis is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.\u201d Source: Reuters\n\nNow, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy\u2019s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I\u2019m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that\u2019s what has given us Donald Trump.\n\nCrime in the nation is down. An American\u2019s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:\n\nFear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic\n\nSure, that\u2019s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn\u2019t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they\u2019ve succeeded.\n\nFeatured image via Franco Origlia/Getty Images.", "authors": ["Wendy Gittleson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "Fox News, the Pope is talking to you.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Wendy Gittleson", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "Fox News, the Pope is talking to you.", "title": "The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism \u2018Terrorism\u2019", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/23/the-pope-flat-out-called-fox-news-type-journalism-terrorism/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-503594898.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fox News, the Pope is talking to you.", "title": "The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism 'Terrorism'", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/23/the-pope-flat-out-called-fox-news-type-journalism-terrorism/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-503594898.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/"}, "keywords": "fox fear, politics of fear, pope francis, terrorism fear, trump fear, xenophobia", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/23/the-pope-flat-out-called-fox-news-type-journalism-terrorism/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-503594898.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7967831c4b263398ad7227f53695cfda?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism \u2018Terrorism\u2019", "url": "http://author.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/23/the-pope-flat-out-called-fox-news-type-journalism-terrorism/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474588800000}, "source": "http://author.addictinginfo.org"}

But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump\u2019s tax returns as well as other things.\n\nLook at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.\n\nDonald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.\n\n521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton\u2019s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.\n\nRegardless of these apparent \u201cwinning\u201d results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.\n\nWith the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let\u2019s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.

{"top_img": "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/charlotte-riot-police-shoot-protester-contradict-witnesses.jpg", "text": "7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nLast night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying \u2013 and that the shot came from law enforcement.\n\nOne key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.\u201d\n\nMy friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 \u2014 Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016\n\nWe interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:\n\nI watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. \u2014 BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let\u2019s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said \u201cHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot,\u201d Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.\n\n\u201cThe protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,\u201d Meyer told me almost breathlessly, \u201cI\u2019ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant \u2018hands up, don\u2019t shoot\u2019 and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter leaving \u2018The Epicenter,\u2019 police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful \u2013 and that\u2019s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.\u201d\n\nMeyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, \u201coh, absolutely.\u201d\n\nFive minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a gunshot,\u201d she told us. \u201cIt was much louder. It wasn\u2019t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly \u2018They just shot him\u2019 and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn\u2019t already left, exited.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.\n\nIt took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was \u2018entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.\u2019\n\nCNN reports, \u201cPolice say the person was shot by a civilian.\u201d\n\nThe City of Charlotte began spinning the protester\u2019s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:\n\nALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. \u2014 City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016\n\nTwo additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police\u2019s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.\n\n\u201cI saw the man go down on the pavement,\u201d said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, \u201cIt was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.\u201d\n\n#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV \u2014 Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016\n\nLastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook \u2013 which was also shared via twitter \u2013 that, \u201cwithin 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.\u201d\n\nWhen African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how \u2013 with more violence.\n\nOriginal story by Grant Stern at PINAC News: \u201cWITNESS: Charlotte Riot Police Did Shoot Protester, Deny Involvement Blaming Civilians\u201c\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

{"top_img": "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/trumpputin2.jpg", "text": "46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nRepublican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He\u2019s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he\u2019s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.\n\nThroughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. \u201cFor the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia\u201d he tweeted in July. Now \u2013 brace yourself, this might come as a shock \u2013 it appears he\u2019s been lying to us the whole time.\n\nAn ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has \u201cnumerous ties\u201d to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. \u201cThe level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate\u2014[and] be associated with Donald Trump\u201d says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.\n\nTrump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to \u201clarge numbers\u201d of Russian buyers \u2013 so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as \u201cLittle Moscow.\u201d\n\nThe oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.\n\nThe oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense \u2013 they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.\n\n\u201cI think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption\u2026They don\u2019t read books. They don\u2019t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht\u201d says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as \u201ccultural ignoramuses\u2026not interested in social justice.\u201d Sound like anyone we know?\n\nWhen the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow\u2019s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves \u2013 and Trump himself. \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking at that, yeah we\u2019ll be looking\u201d said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.\n\nThese business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it\u2019s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.\n\nWatch ABC News\u2019 report here:\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

{"top_img": "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/christieimpeach.jpg", "text": "71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:\n\nThe decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.\n\nChris Christie is also Republican Presidential\u2019s nominee Donald Trump\u2019s transition team chairperson.\n\nJust four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world\u2019s busiest bridges.\n\nGovernor Christie was Trump\u2019s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major \u201cconservative\u201d Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump\u2019s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.\n\nFamously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It\u2019s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor\u2019s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.\n\nLast week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.\n\nThe Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration\u2019s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year\u2019s Republican Presidential campaign.\n\nWatch his shame:\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

{"top_img": "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/trumpliar-1.jpg", "text": "11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nDuring a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because \u201che would\u2019ve gotten it, if I wanted it.\u201d But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul \u2013 this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:\n\nOne of these stories is a lie\u2014a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump\u2019s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn\u2019t want to admit he lost.\n\nAssume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush\u2019s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies\u2014he had played the \u201ccash for outcomes\u201d political game for years\u2014he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush\u2019s opposition\u2014if Trump had wanted it.\n\nThe transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would\u2019ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump\u2019s na\u00efve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald\u2019s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:\n\nNow consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn\u2019t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple\u2014Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.\n\nWhy is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater \u201cscandal\u201d for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.\n\nRepublicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump\u2019s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party\u2019s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it\u2019s head.\n\nTrump\u2019s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it\u2019s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.\n\nSee for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there\u2019s no third option here:\n\nBush: \u201cThe one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something\u2014that was generous and gave me money\u2014was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.\u201d Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn\u2019t\u2014 Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn\u2019t get it, because I was opposed to\u2014 Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before\u2014 Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I\u2019m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.\n\nTranscript of 2007 Trial Deposition:\n\nA lawyer asked Trump, \u201cDid you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?\u201d Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush\u2026and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn\u2019t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn\u2019t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

It\u2019s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin\u2019s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.\n\nPutin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: \u201chumourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.\u201d\n\nSo remember \u2013 don\u2019t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section.

{"top_img": "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/theil-1.jpg", "text": "13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nS Trump\u2019s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company\u2019s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.\n\nSources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment\u2019s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump\u2019s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. \u201cThe likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nIronically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee\u2019s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel\u2019s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he\u2019s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.\n\nThiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan\u2019s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire\u2019s then-secret sexual orientation.\n\nBut now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP\u2019s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, \u201cEvery American has a unique identity. I\u2019m proud to be gay, I\u2019m proud to be a Republican,\u201d after a lengthy rant against \u201cgovernment incompetence.\u201d He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.\n\nUnfortunately, his own party didn\u2019t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.\n\n\u201cFederal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,\u201d said the Department of Labor\u2019s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. \u201cOur nation\u2019s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.\u201d Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself \u201cvigorously\u201d and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.\n\nNow, the executive who accused his employer \u2013 the federal government \u2013 of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company\u2019s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

It is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill, sinners, attention seekers, and just plain weirdos in general. I am not going to stand by while under classed and underprivileged people are oppressed. I am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country. I am not going to live in a country where it is OK to have a misogynist, xenophobic, racist Islamophobic, republican candidate running for President of The United States! That\u2019s implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people. This is not the end, this is just the beginning.

That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.\n\nDonald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He\u2019s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He\u2019s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He\u2019s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to \u201crelax\u201d he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he\u2019s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he\u2019s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump\u2019s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it\u2019s just gibberish:\n\nFive people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016\n\nJust\u2026what is he talking about? If you\u2019re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.\n\nTalking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He\u2019s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.\n\nFeatured image from file", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "Democrats Winning the Hearts and Minds", "description": "Things aren't looking good here.", "title": "Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End\u2013May Be Unfit For Debate", "url": "http://oppositionreport.com/donald-trump-goes-off-the-deep-end-may-be-unfit-for-debate/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TrumpPins-Twitter.jpg", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TrumpPins-Twitter.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1555147758043521}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cropped-2015-12-18_18-30-53-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1; maximum-scale=1; user-scalable=0;"}, "canonical_link": "http://oppositionreport.com/donald-trump-goes-off-the-deep-end-may-be-unfit-for-debate/", "images": ["http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Baio-Fox.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-5.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/themes/ares/data/1488260315_logo copy.jpg", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/01de25360ee280d1bd8f0b9a1f25034e?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/trump-1-6.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/trump-11.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TrumpPins-Twitter.jpg", "http://oppositionreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/joe-raedle-houston-flood-getty-OR.jpg"], "title": "Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End\u2013May Be Unfit For Debate \u2039 Opposition Report", "url": "http://winningdemocrats.com/donald-trump-goes-off-the-deep-end-may-be-unfit-for-debate/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://winningdemocrats.com"}

According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed \u201cwatered down\u201d drugs to third-world countries.\n\nFrom The Daily Caller:\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed \u201cwatered-down\u201d HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and \u201clikely increased\u201d the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. \u2014 The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. \u2014 The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u2014 The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation\u2019s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the \u201cwatered-down\u201d drugs.\n\nThis latest report proves that the Clinton Foundation should be SHUT DOWN immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching Bill and Hillary!\n\nDo you think that the Clinton Foundation should be shut down immediately before it continues to harm more and more people around the world?

For real.\n\nThis is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from \u201cintentionally or knowingly touching\u201d the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don\u2019t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.\n\nThe AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that \u201cprosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.\u201d They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?\n\nIn others words, just trust the prosecutors, y\u2019all. There\u2019s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.\n\nWow.\n\nThere are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here\u2019s an especially interesting tidbit:\n\nAs Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority\u2019s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court\u2019s help, Arizona\u2019s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver\u2014out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state\u2019s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona\u2019s parents and caregivers.\n\nYikes.\n\nBut I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y\u2019all. Because doesn\u2019t government always know best?", "authors": ["Mockarena Cotr"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court.", "og": {"site_name": "Chicks On The Right", "description": "A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court.", "title": "Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona - Chicks On The Right", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 812, "identifier": "https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg", "height": 550}, "url": "https://www.chicksontheright.com/2016/09/19/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg", "description": "A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court.", "card": "summary", "title": "Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona - Chicks On The Right"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ChicksOnTheRight/", "section": "Constitution", "tag": "felony", "published_time": "2016-09-19T20:49:22-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ChicksOnTheRight/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.chicksontheright.com/2016/09/19/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a2fb62ae885c1cdb2a0c69249a9c25a?s=120&d=mm&r=g", "http://www.chicksontheright.com/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/?utm_source=RWN&utm_medium=RWN&utm_campaign=RWN#!", "https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cotrolog-smalll.png", "https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CotR_banner1-copy-2.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8W3QtpyKy7xuZ.gif", "http://rightchicks.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/book-thumb.jpg", "https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49-812x478.jpg", "https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg", "https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kardashian-jenner-424x250.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-d1x2X8_nNBHjc.gif"], "title": "Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona", "url": "http://www.chicksontheright.com/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/?utm_source=RWN&utm_medium=RWN&utm_campaign=RWN", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474332562000}, "source": "http://www.chicksontheright.com"}

Anything with \u2018Clinton\u2019 in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed \u201cwatered-down\u201d HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this\u2026 the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I\u2019m betting that they did.\n\nRanbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation\u2019s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,\u201d said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.\n\nFrom The Daily Caller:\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed \u201cwatered-down\u201d HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and \u201clikely increased\u201d the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,\u201cThe Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,\u201d was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. \u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton\u2019s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.\n\n\u201cThe question becomes, \u2018how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,\u2019\u201d asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.\n\nThis could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation\u2019s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the \u201cwatered-down\u201d drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.\n\nProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered \u201cmore than $1.8 million packages.\u201d \u201cSubstandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,\u201d Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.\n\nRanbaxy\u2019s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton\u2019s charity have not severed ties with them either.\n\nCompanies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money.

There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that\u2019s no joke. They shouldn\u2019t be cleared to clean a toilet there.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn\u2019t do. It\u2019s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath.\n\nFrom The Daily Caller:\n\nA frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department\u2019s motion to dismiss TheDCNF\u2019s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF\u2019s request to depose State Department officials. \u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.\n\nHuma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don\u2019t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail\u2026 guess we just aren\u2019t the \u2018right people\u2019.\n\nJudge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said \u201cJudge Leon\u2019s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department\u2019s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.\u201d I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It\u2019s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is \u2018corruption\u2019.\n\nState Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the \u201ccourses were not completed\u201d by Clinton or her aides.

This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable \u2013 except by Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:\n\nWhile on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics \u2026. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.\n\nAfter Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:\n\nFor the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator \u2026 to call out those lies and to do that in real time.\n\nUnfortunately, with Trump\u2019s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it\u2019s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to \u201cshine\u201d at the debate if she hopes to \u201cwin.\u201d This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.\n\nHopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.\n\nIf there is one thing this election has shown us, it\u2019s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.\n\nFeatured image via Sara D.

health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.\n\n\u201cShe has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton\u2019s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,\u201d the lawyer

If they want to stick with their own programs then they should have stayed put in their countries of origin.\n\n(Via JewsNews) Quebec mayor gives Muslim \u2018refugees\u2019 a little piece of his mind by spilling the truth that Canadians don\u2019t adapt to them, it\u2019s the other way around.\n\n\u201d MUSLIMS MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST ADAPT TO CANADA, ITS CUSTOMS, ITS TRADITIONS, ITS WAY OF LIFE, BECAUSE IT WAS THE COUNTRY THAT WAS CHOSEN TO EMIGRATE. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT THEY MUST INTEGRATE AND LEARN TO LIVE IN CANADA. NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TO BE FOR THEM TO CHANGE THEIR LIFESTYLE, NOT THE CANADIANS WHO SO GENEROUSLY WELCOMED THEM. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT CANADIANS ARE NOT RACIST OR XENOPHOBIC. WE ACCEPT MANY IMMIGRANTS, IN MANY COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT CULTURES AND RELIGIONS, CONTRADICTING TO MANY MUSLIM COUNTRIES WHICH DO NOT ACCEPT IMMIGRANTS NON-MUSLIMS. FOR THIS REASON, THE CANADIANS ARE NOT WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR CULTURE. FINALLY, THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN CANADA, WITH ITS JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ROOTS, CHRISTMAS TREES, CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS, RELIGION MUST REMAIN IN THE PRIVATE SPHERE. THE MUNICIPALITY OF DURVAL HAS THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY CONCESSIONS TO ISLAM AND SHARIA LAW. FOR MUSLIMS, WHO ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE CANADIAN CULTURE AND RELIGION AND DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN CANADA, THERE ARE 57 BEAUTIFUL MUSLIM COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, MOST OF THEM UNDER-POPULATED AND READY TO RECEIVE THEM WITH OPEN ARMS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA LAW. IF YOU LEFT HIS COUNTRY TO COME TO CANADA, AND NOT TO A MUSLIM COUNTRY, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THAT LIFE IS BETTER IN CANADA THAN IN OTHER PLACES. HELP YOURSELF TO THE QUESTION, JUST ONCE: WHY IS IT BETTER HERE IN CANADA THAT WHERE IT COMES FROM.\n\nIt boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives. This is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans.\n\nWhile most Americans are perplexed as to how a foreign entity could trump American law on our own sovereign soil, Texas isn\u2019t waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue, but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute Sharia law within the American Judicial System\n\nBecause Muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or don\u2019t. Just do block others from it. Boom. There it is.

They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?\n\nNow a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they\u2019re funded by Soros TOO! It\u2019s called \u2018Common Defense PAC\u2019 and their mantra is: \u201cAs veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThen on the \u2018leadership team\u2019 page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called \u201cSenator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org\u2019s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. \u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.\u201d The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to \u201cun-endorse Donald J. Trump.\u201d ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans \u201ccame to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.\u201d\n\nCommon sense PAC\u2019s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group\u2019s Director, Perry O\u2019Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His \u2018Iraq Veterans Against the War\u2019 bio describes him:\n\nPerry O\u2019Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe PAC that\u2019s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? O\u2019Brien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called \u201cTell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.\u201d The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O\u2019Brien to start the shallow PAC. With all of these shell groups being created solely to destroy Trump and funded by Soros, do you think that Trump stands a chance against the Left?", "authors": ["Tiffiny Ruegner"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "og": {"site_name": "John Hawkins' Right Wing News", "description": "A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros.

Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary\u2019s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey\u2019s fate.\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. \u201cThis now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director\u2019s fitness for office,\u201d DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills\u2019 computer. \u201cThe contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was not a real investigation.

We don\u2019t need their oil\u2026 we would make do. The majority of the 9/11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia, as does the Bin Laden family. The Saudi deputy crown prince told reporters in June the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has funded 20% of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. She\u2019s taking money from a stone cold enemy and that\u2019s not the only one by any means. You do not consort or take money from those who intend to destroy your country\u2026 period. That goes for Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. It also includes any dictatorship or communist strongman. We never learn our lesson, do we?\n\nNow it comes to light that Saudi Arabia is selling ISIS sex slaves off to the highest bidder at public auctions. Iraqis, Syrians, Saudis and WESTERNERS all bought slaves at the auction. This is monstrous and going on right out in the open. It should be stopped cold\u2026 whatever it takes. Britain needs to stop selling the Saudis weapons and we need to pull our politicians out of the Saudi bedroom and back home. They are killing us and enslaving women and children. How can we silently stand by while this evil goes on?\n\nFrom Jihad Watch:\n\nIt isn\u2019t news that the Islamic State has long been abusing and trafficking sex slaves \u2013 especially Yazidi girls \u2013 but it has been now discovered that the sex slaves of IS are being \u201csold in horrifying auctions to UK ally Saudi Arabia.\u201d An eyewitness reported: \u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now Dozens of women were being held in a large room, and it was not only Iraqis and Syrians trading women but also Saudis and Westerners, whose actual nationality was not clear. Western women have also been reported to be among the victims in keeping with the Islamic State\u2019s practice of enslaving kafir women: The Islamic State\u2019s human trafficking operation includes enslaving women who they consider to be \u2018kafir\u2019, non-Muslim people like Yazidis and Christians, before selling them for money. The depraved thugs are also involved in the radicalisation of young women all over the world and try to tempt them to come to their caliphate with false promises of wealth, marriage and forgiveness of sin.\n\nAs these women are \u2018rescued\u2019 from ISIS, they are not being given freedom. They are being sold on the auction block into a hellish existence. These are the people that Hillary Clinton takes money from, makes deals with and hobnobs with. Monsters of a feather.\n\nI have said for a long time, not only are the Saudis sponsoring ISIS, so are the Russians. We are being played. Our own president is complicit. Let\u2019s not elect another corrupt demon who cares nothing of women and children being sold to rapists.

I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn\u2019t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it\u2019s sort of like either do it or don\u2019t do it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn\u2019t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he\u2019s under a lot of pressure,\u201d said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.\n\nYou can see it here:\n\nInstead of hammering Trump for his alleged \u201csupport\u201d for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.\n\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump\u2019s name.\n\nLuckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.\n\nShare this on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you thought of the debate on Monday night.\n\n*USA Politics Today has since pulled their story.", "authors": ["Martin Lioll", "John Falkenberg", "Ben Marquis", "Kimberly J Smith", "Martin Walsh", "V Saxena", "Benjamin Arie"],

Hillary didn\u2019t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!\n\nThe latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear\u2026is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?\n\nTwitter may have figured out the answer\u2026do you see it?\n\nIt certainly wouldn\u2019t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a \u201cCough prevention machine\u201d in her hideous feminist pantsuit?\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.\n\n\u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now\n\nFox News reported that \u201cClinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.\u201d\n\nWhile we aren\u2019t sure what was going on inside Hillary\u2019s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, \u201cDid u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?\u201d\n\nWoods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter\u2026\u201cShe can\u2019t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.\u201d\n\nThen Woods added:\n\n\u201cShe literally can\u2019t help herself. She\u2019s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.\u201d\n\nOf course, we don\u2019t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.\n\nSome claim it\u2019s merely a reflection of studio lights. We\u2019ll let you be the judge.", "authors": ["Lisa Smith"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "og": {"site_name": "John Hawkins' Right Wing News", "description": "There\u2019s a lot that could be discussed about last night\u2019s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that\u2019s not the main concern right now.
